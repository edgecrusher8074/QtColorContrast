## QtColorContrast
To settle an arguement with a colleague, I've coded this small application for displaying the contrast ratio between the textcolor and the background color of a label.

The contrast value is calculated using [Contrast (Minimum) - Understanding SC 1.4.3](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html "Contrast (Minimum) - Understanding SC 1.4.3").

The luminance calculation is performed using [Relative Luminance](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wiki/Relative_luminance "Relative Luminance").

The Qt version used for developing this application is 5.15.
